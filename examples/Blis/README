WHAT IS BLIS?
=============

BLIS (BiCePS Linear Integer Solver) is an example of an application developed
on top of BiCePS (See the README of BiCePS). BLIS is a simple branch and cut
solver for Mixed Integer Linear Programming. Its purpose is to illustrate how
to write an application based on BiCePS. The version of BLIS here is an older
version of the full-blown MILP solver that is distributed separately. We keep
it around to use as a test bed for BiCePS. For serious use, please check out
the full version of Blis.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

The html documentation of the classes in BLIS (See INSTALL of BLIS) can be 
created. A user's guide that is under preparation that can help users to 
develop an application.


INSTALLATION
============
