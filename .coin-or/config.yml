  LongDescription: |2
    The Branch, Constrain, and Price Software (BiCePS) is a data management
    layer for CHiPPS, the COIN-OR High Performance Parallel Search Framework.
    CHiPPS is a framework for implementing parallel algorithms based on tree
    search. BiCePS is built on top of ALPS and provides functionality for
    implementing relaxation-based branch-and-bound algorithms.
