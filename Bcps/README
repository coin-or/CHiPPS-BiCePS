WHAT IS BCPS?
=============

Bcps is one of the libraries that make up the Cops (COIN Open Parallel Search
Framework) library hierarchy. It implements that data-handling functions
needed to support development of many types of relaxation-based
branch-and-bound algorithms, especially for solving mathematical programs. It
is intended to capture the implementation of methods common to all such
algorithms without assuming anything about the structure of the mathematical
program or the bounding method used. Blis, which is another layer built on top
of Bcps, is a concretization of Bcps for the case of mixed integer linear
programs. DECOMP is another implementation being developed using Blis that
implements a decomposition-based bounding procedure.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

The html documentation of the classes in Bcps (See INSTALL file) can be
created. A user's guide that is under preparation that can help with running
or customizing Bcps.

INSTALLATION
============
