(including Linux, OS X, AIX, Cygwin and MSys). Additional details for building
this and other COIN projects are available at

**********************************************************************

BiCePS has been packaged for some Linux distributions and is in the
process of being packaged for Homebrew on OS X. For Windows, pre-built
binaries are available as part of the COIN-OR Optimization Suite:

https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OptimizationSuite/

To build from source, you can obtain the source code for BiCePS in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended). For this, you need a subversion client installed. For a
   command-line client, check out the code with

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CHiPPS/Bcps/stable/0.94 Bcps-0.94

2. Download the source in a compressed file from from
   http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/CHiPPS and
   extract it, for example, with

   tar -xzvf Bcps-0.94.0.tgz

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/CHiPPS

1. Serial Solver
----------------

Switch to the directory in which you just downloaded or extracted the source
(e.g., Bcps-0.94) and execute the following commands:

  1) ./configure
  2) make
  3) make test
  4) make install 

2. Parallel Solver (MPI as message passing interface) 
-----------------------------------------------------

For configuration and and compilation of the MPI parallel solver, the user has
to specify the location of MPI with options --with-mpi-incdir, --with-mpi-lib,
MPICC, and MPICXX. Switch to the directory that you just downloaded or
extracted (e.g., Bcps-0.94) and execute the following commands (substituting
the correct paths and command names).

  1) ./configure --enable-debug --with-mpi-incdir=/usr/local/mpich/include
--with-mpi-lib='-L/usr/local/mpich/lib -lmpich' MPICC=mpicc
MPICXX=mpiCC
  2) make 
  3) make install

You might want to specify other options, in case you don't want to 
use the default choices that configure makes (e.g., compilers).

3. Building Examples
--------------------

To build the example code (Blis), configure and build as above. Switch
into the appropriate subdirectory in the source distribution and type "make".
